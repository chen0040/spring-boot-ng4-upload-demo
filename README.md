## Angular 4 Application

To run the angular application that communicate with the spring-boot-application:

npm install
ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check --port 8080
```

This will start the angular application at http://localhost:8080

After the angular site is launched, if you have not login before, click the login button on the page, you can authenticate using
any account below:

* username: admin password: admin
* username: user password: user

The websocket implementation that subscribe to "/topics/" + token + "/event" websocket topic of the spring-boot-application can be found in the app.service.ts and app.component.ts

Once at http://localhost:8080, click "Excel Sample Download" to download a csv sample, then click "Choose File" to load the
downloaded Excel sample,and then click "Upload Excel", you will notice that as the product is being saved on the remote server,
the web page keeps on updating the progress (done using websocket and sockjs). At the backend, the Thread.sleep is used to simulate
long running process.
